Description: Allows users to input tracking data for a hurricane
    or other tropical storm, along with a data frame of grid points at which
    to model wind speeds. Functions in this package will then calculate wind
    speeds at each point based on wind model equations. This modeling framework
    is currently set up to model winds for North American locations with 
    Atlantic basin storms. This work was supported 
    in part by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health 
    Sciences (R00ES022631), the National Science Foundation (1331399), and the 
    Department of Energy (DE-FG02-08ER64644).
